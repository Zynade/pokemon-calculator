A simple project made by [Zynade](https://github.com/Zynade), [farcat576](https://github.com/farcat576) and [Wadedacoder](https://github.com/Wadedacoder) as a bonus assignment for the *CSE101: Introduction to Programming* course offered at IIIT Delhi.
  
This Pokémon Battle Calculator takes in two Pokémons and their moves as input, and displays the winner, along with relevant statistics. It uses the PokéAPI API.
